### Whoami
Back in 2012, I co-founded Klug (Kerman Linux Users Group), a non-profit organization aimed at advocating for the free-software culture. We organized some national conferences like the Ubuntu 16.10 release party that attracted more than 300 people. We involved some young and aspiring teenagers in the free-software culture, most of whom are now very successful in their fields.

I worked at didi.ir for a couple of years, where our software provided internet to more than 20,000 users. Then I went to work at Ketabnak.com for about 2 years, where I refactored a decade old UI, introduced code versioning, and implemented project management methods like Scrum to the system. And now, since 2021, Iâ€™ve been working on an ISP Management Software for xGate which provides internet for people in more than 10 countries around the world.
