### Whoami
Back in 2012, I co-founded Klug (Kerman Linux Users Group), a non-profit organization aimed at advocating for the free-software culture. At the time, as a younger person, I hoped to be a more effective person in promoting the culture of free software. The foundation is now inactive, but we organized some national conferences like the Ubuntu 16.10 release party that attracted more than 300 people. We involved some young and aspiring teenagers in the free-software culture, most of whom are now very successful in their fields.

I also worked at didi.ir for a couple of years, where our software provided internet service for more than 20,000 people. Then I went to work at Ketabnak.com for about 2 years, where I refactored a decade old UI, introduced code versioning, and implemented project management methods like Scrum to the system. And now, since 2021, Iâ€™ve been working on an ISP Management Software for xGate which provides internet for people in more than 10 countries around the world.
